## Experience

Over the last 5 years I have been involved in many projects including security, developer tooling and compute.
Working at the foundation layer has also taught me a lot about communication and collaboration 
with other teams which is essential to drive projects to a successful conclusion.

Nitro Inc., Dublin, Ireland – (Feb 2020 – September 2022)

The first goal when joining the team was to migrate from a legacy container orchestrator to Kubernetes hosted on AWS.
The challenge was to keep all systems operational while also onboarding the engineering teams.
Through careful planning and communication we successfully achieved our goal.
Next I improved the architecture and scalability of our servers and implemented automations for applying infrastructure changes. 
I also took on new responsibilities such as leading operational excellence meetings.

Our team lead was a constant source of guidance and helped me grow in my role.
From him I learned the importance of having strong engineering principles that guide how you approach the work that lies ahead.

TMO Group, Shanghai, China – (Oct 2017 – Nov 2019)

After graduating with a Masters in computer science in June 2017, I landed my first job at 
a small ecommerce tech company in China. It was my first hands-on experience with managing 
production systems and developer tools. I had to learn new tools such as Docker, Nginx, Kubernetes
the hard way by getting my hands dirty. 

I am most proud of introducing Kubernetes to simplify deployment of applications and Grafana 
for monitoring and alerting.
