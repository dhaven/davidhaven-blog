Experiencing ballooning cloud bills, lack  of visibility in your cloud operations or flaky security? 
I’m here to help. I’ve worked for 5 years with AWS and other cutting edge technologies such as Kubernetes 
and Terraform to deliver the infrastructure that is needed to confidently grow your business.  
Outcome-driven, I aim to implement long lasting solutions that are simple, well documented and maintainable.

### How I can help

→ Shape your infrastructure for scalability and resiliency.

→ Deep cost analysis of your cloud operations and how to reduce the bill.

→ Improve developer velocity through a modern CI/CD approach.

→ Assess the security posture of your cloud infrastructure and suggest path to improvements.
