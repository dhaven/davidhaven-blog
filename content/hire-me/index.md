I will take your infrastructure to the next level. Some of the areas I have expertise in include:
- In depth cost review and proposal of optimizations
- Process automation
- Implementation of new cloud native services such as Kubernetes or ArgoCD
- Best practices for Cloud environment security.
- And much more...

Because it's not all about achieving results but also about how you achieve them.
I have a set of strong values that guide all of my work:
- Ownership
- Clear communication
- Knowledge sharing
- Build for the long term
- Everything as code

## What people I've worked with have to say about me

> I worked with David for a little over two years, with the last year as his manager. In that time, I was continually impressed by
> David's intelligence, problem solving, and his ability to get the hard work done. He engineers solutions that are well thought out
> and easily maintainable. David is an absolute pleasure to work with and a true professional. I am happy to recommend him without
> reservation. He was an asset to our team and company, and I have no doubt that he will be to yours as well.
